# BrainResectionApp
This is a MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) for accurate delineation of the resected brain region within the patientâ€™s MRI space. It integrates a validated semi-automated segmentation pipeline based on a hybrid approach combining region growing algorithm on post-operative MRI with the patient-specific pre-operative mask. Designed to maximize user efficiency and the output accuracy, the GUI is focused entirely on segmenting the resection cavity, where parameter selection is simplified and kept to a minimum and where the user is only asked to place an initial seed anywhere in the cavity that he/she desires to accurately delineate. This GUI is also designed to extract the resection cavity volume and its neuroanatomical labelling. For further and more detailed information on the use of the GUI, or on its inputs/outputs, please refer to the BrainResectionApp_Guide file. The source code is freely available, its use and future validation are highly encouraged.
